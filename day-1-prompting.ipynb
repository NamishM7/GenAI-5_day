    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For help\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

He dreamt of faraway lands, of chasing butterflies in fields of wildflowers, of scaling mountains and swimming in crystal-clear lakes.\n",

He crept closer, his emerald eyes gleaming with mischief. As the delivery man turned his back, Barnaby leaped, landing gracefully inside the box.\n",

      "\n",
      "He sniffed the air, a symphony of scents filling his nostrils: freshly cut grass, blooming roses, and the sweet aroma of popcorn from a nearby vendor. A squirrel, its tail twitching, scurried up a tree, and Barnaby, his hunter instincts ignited, gave chase. He leaped and climbed, his claws finding purchase on the rough bark. The squirrel, nimble and quick, escaped, but Barnaby, panting but exhilarated, had tasted adventure.\n",
      "\n",
      "He explored the park, his senses on high alert. He chased butterflies, their wings a kaleidoscope of colors, and batted at playful pigeons. He even befriended a fluffy white dog, sharing a juicy bone and a playful romp.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the park, Barnaby felt a pang of longing for home. He missed the familiar scent of his human, the warmth of his favorite blanket. He knew he had to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "He found his way back to the delivery truck, its back door now open. He leaped inside, the familiar scent of grass bringing a wave of nostalgia. The journey back was just as bumpy, but this time, Barnaby felt a sense of contentment. He had tasted adventure, and it had filled him with a newfound appreciation for his cozy life at home.\n",

He closed his eyes, a contented purr rumbling in his chest. He had seen the world, and it had been wonderful, but home, he realized, was where his heart truly belonged. And maybe, just maybe, he would have another adventure someday. \n",
